        <p>The fans rattled as they moved hot air through the warehouse. Packed with spectators, sharp whistles bounced off the walls, slicing through the humidity of the tournament. The blue mat stuck to the bottoms of my feet, as I squared up for the sparring match. My eyes wandered away from my opponent, though, and found Granny’s platinum blonde bob. My stomach twisted. She was sitting next to my dad, arms crossed, staring down at me through a pair of green and black sunglasses. 
	It was the championship match. My opponent was nine, two years older than me. We were dressed in white doboks and padding with red targets on our chests. She bobbed up and down on her toes, while my coach gently reminded me to put my hands up to protect myself. I chewed on my mouthguard as my eyes moved between my opponent and Granny. 
	The referee signaled for us to begin. The girl let out a war-cry that rattled my bones. She darted across the mat and reared a decapitating roundhouse. I dodged. I drove an open palm onto the red dot on her chest. She shouted, stumbled, so I did it again. She traded blows with me. I felt the sting of copper in my mouth. I hit her even harder. Each time I punched she stumbled backward. I slammed my palms on the red dot over and over until the wind was knocked out of her. I didn’t notice if she was fighting back anymore. My frenzy blocked it out, and only stopped when I heard the whistle. My opponent had stepped off the mat. 
	I’d won. It was the first time I had won anything. I looked to the crowd to see my dad cheering and clapping. Granny was stagnant, looking down on me.  
	Granny brought a digital camera with her everywhere she went. When I was awarded my medal, she rapid-fired photos with the flash on. She admired them, saying how much I looked like my father, making me cringe. But I didn’t dare show it. I had a vision that if I did, it would end with me digging my own grave on a patch of red dirt in the parking lot. 
	After Granny had my dad take a photo of the two of us, she gripped my shoulder with an iron fist and pulled me aside next to a fan. One of its blades was banging against the cage around it. The breeze dried the sweat on my skin, making me shiver. 
	She towered above me as she said, “that wasn’t 110 percent, Miss Emma.” 
	“110 percent?” 
	“You didn’t give 110 percent of your effort.” 
	“But I won.” 
	“And?” 
	I held up the gold medal as a response, and repeated, “I won.” 
	“That wasn’t the best you could do.” 
	My heart stung. The feeling festered. 
	I learned the meaning of hierarchy from Granny: Granny sits at the peak of a mountain where the air is thin, but she doesn’t feel the difference. I can’t see her from the bottom; she’s obscured by a blizzard. She stayed away from my line of sight. But I felt Granny’s presence watching me, her legacy, compete with her expectations. 
Growing up, I found myself slipping away during family events at her home. The rooms were like a museum draped in stretches of black and white lining, dark masonry, and emerald ceilings. There was an exception though. One wing held a hallway that was decorated with framed newspaper clippings of her and her husband’s family business. Her face was plastered underneath headlines all written along the same lines, but with different dates: Most influential, charitable, entrepreneur in Oklahoma. 
At the end of this hallway was her living room. Lighting the room was a wall of stained-glass windows that cast green, gold, and red light onto more photographs. The photographs packed all the walls from the floor to the ceiling. They ranged from black and white, grainy colored photos, and sharp saturated ones. I saw photos of her and Grandad from when they were young, when she had jet black hair and he was still a cherry blond. The centerpiece of the room was a massive painting of her grandchildren. She’s never taken a photo down, only added. 
	I took notes of her clothes, her home, her sons and daughters, remarks about her past, and every word she’s ever said to me outside of ‘I miss you.’ All I wanted to know was her, who she really was, instead of the silhouette of a person I saw looming above me. This mosaic of notes will paint a rough, incomplete, portrait of her. But there are a few things I know for certain about her: Granny is eighty-four and has not retired. She will never retire, not even in her grave. She spends her time aiding various charities, tending to her nine grandchildren and business, and attending pickle-ball lessons with her friends. She will pay close attention to every habit, tic, and expression someone unknowingly gives her. She can uncover any hidden desire, or intention. In her old age, she uses it to work a room in her favor. 
	I’ve seen her do it at holiday parties, cocktail hours, and weddings. She’d make some time to say hello and snap a photo of me, before she found her targets: the Tulsa oil tycoons, their real estate developer juniors, and the nouveau riche of the Great Plains. Granny would make the rounds; she’d greet each man with a smile. The handshake involved her allowing them to clasp her hand, but she would be the one to place her hand on their forearm. Sometimes it was a man with old money in his pocket, other times it could’ve been a lucky investment in Apple in ’78. To Granny, they just had to be rich. Not even handsome. Little did these men know, her emerald acrylics were being used to hook them in. The hooks were hidden by her asking about their grandchildren, or how they were holding up with the loss of their alma mater football team. As the conversation floated between niceties and some gossip, she would yank on the hook, sinking it in. 
	“I was just talking to Jake Foster over there, and he was telling me about how he heard that Gerald, junior not senior, decided that he’s going to donate 200k to Catholic Charities. I said, only 200k!” She joked. 
	The man gave her a tight-lipped smile. “Are y’all close to your goal?” 
	“Well, I pledged about 350k, so now we’re at about two million.” 
	Granny wouldn’t break her gaze from the man as she said this. She would keep her shoulders square to him. She knew that he had made three times more than her in that year. The man would continue the conversation as normal, his mind spinning as he felt the room closing in on him. How could Jake Foster, Gerald Junior, and a woman each be donating more than him? 
	With a sip of her glass, followed by an email from the rich man to his secretary after the cocktails were dried up, a woman’s hospital could be built. Next, it would be a school for homeless children. After that, a rehab center for the opioid epidemic. She could fundraise millions of dollars in seven minutes, by measuring dicks. 
	None of those facilities would exist without her methodology. I can only imagine what she used to use it for when she and her husband were first building the business. My father told me she was the one who balanced the books. She had dropped her studies in journalism to help my grandfather, a dropout too, in a forgotten town that had no sidewalks, flooded when it rained an inch, and their business was the only gas station for miles. The station was nestled between a gristmill, the industrial jewel of the town, and a dilapidated motel. Granny’s role was the rake through the nitty gritties of the operation for any hidden oversights. She also tended to a growing family, while Grandad would expand the business according to her calculations. During this time of her life, I imagine her sitting at the base of a mountain, searching for possible routes up as she clawed through numbers and inventory. The frigid wind was harsh against her black hair, not yet bleached blonde. She found her foothold and climbed alone. 
	I wonder what kept her climbing, how did she not fall with her struggles and the responsibilities of the business and her children? What fueled her to keep working? And why have inherited her compulsion to climb alone? 
Once, at eighteen, I was at her home for a birthday party. It was spring. I remember the sunlight against my skin as I sat next to the wall of stained glass in her living room. I listened to the patter of cloudbursts ebb and flow against the panes. The room warmed with a swell of loud voices. I looked across the room, past the crowd of family members, and watched Granny pour a heavy glass of red wine in her kitchen. The green and gold light illuminated her outline and turned the wine bright red as she took the first sip. She made the rounds afterward, sitting down and speaking to each child and grandchild until their turn was up. Granny walked as if she were floating, with her shoulders back, and when she spoke to people, she would stand too close. Her hand rested on her hip as she sipped and gave them a practiced smile. 
	Granny set her glass on the coaster next to me. Her posture was perfect as she sat in the lazy boy. She wore white jeans, sandals, and a white blouse. 
	Granny reached out, grabbed a few strands of my hair. “You got a haircut.” 
	“I did,” I said, surprised. I hadn’t seen her in a month. 
	“You should grow it out more,” she said. “It’s something people envy about you.” 
	“I’ll trim it next time then.” 
	There was a pause as she smiled, scanning me. “You look so much like your father.” She flicked her gaze to Dad, across the room, before returning it to me. “I thought you’d grow out of it by now.” Granny trailed off, looking past me, her mind darting along another web of thoughts before she abruptly said, “and I honestly thought your father would never amount to anything.” 
His name is Frank, the fourth of his name, and he is the youngest of her four biological children, and the only one to inherit her straight, black, hair. Ever since he learned fine motor skills, he wanted to help his mother out. When he was five, he cleaned Granny’s old carpet by setting it on fire. It was the fastest way. At seven he thought the garden was too muddy, so he busted out her new vacuum and cleaned up the mulch and flowers himself. He got into a brawl with the neighbors when he was twelve because they stole Granny’s kitten, he got the kitten back but lost a tooth. When he was old enough swing an axe, he thought their rotting gazebo was an eyesore and spent an entire afternoon chopping it down. He graduated high school a few months later and shipped off to play football out of state; he spent two years there before flunking out and moving back to Oklahoma. Fortunately, he graduated with an English degree, and worked as a bellboy his first job out of university. The lady who hired him, his boss, claimed to be a psychic. She told him this at a dive bar, the type that had sticky wooden floors and a flickering, blue, Coors Light sign in the window. She said to him she’s been able to see into people’s pasts and futures since she’d been struck by lightning. 
“I know this might sound strange,” she told him. “But I hear a name every time I see you. I have a feeling you’re going to marry this woman.” 
“Bullshit.”
His boss grabbed a napkin, pulled a red pen from her shirt pocket, and wrote Melia. He knew the name; he couldn’t ever forget Malia. He’d met her three years earlier. She appeared to Frank in fragments, one moment he glimpsed her wavy, brunette, hair bouncing as she passed him on the sidewalk, and the next he saw her siting in the park with her nose in an anatomy textbook. He finally caught up to her at three in the morning, the night before winter break; he watched her escape from the chaos of the frat party and go upstairs. He went to check on her and found that she crawled onto the roof through an open window. Her breath floated around her silhouette, lit by the blue Christmas lights below them. 
He said hello and climbed next to her, asking if she was okay. 
She was sipping on a red solo cup. “My ex decided to show up,” she laughed, exacerbated. “He wants his cable back.”
“You should give it back to him, after we go on our first Cola date.”
Malia grinned. “Maybe, but I really like watching those reruns of Dynasty a little more than I like soda.”
“I can wait.” 
After that beer with his boss, Frank tracked Malia down. They went on one date before having to do long distance. Frank wrote her dozens of letters for six weeks before seeing her again. And, naturally, he proposed to Malia in his parent’s hot tub.
Granny hadn’t met Malia before that evening. When she and Granny first met, all my father’s siblings were there as well. Granny pulled my aunts aside when he was proposing to her, and said something along the lines of, thank the Lord she pretty and smarter than him, and that hair of hers! Let’s pray that their children get it, and that they’re girls! 
Granny pulled her hand away from my wavy hair, folding her palms in her lap. “Frank surprised me though. He needed some help, but now look at him, he’s one of my favorites.” 
Her son was laughing loudly across the room with Malia. When Granny turned her attention back to me, she moved her cold hand to my shoulder. 
“Don’t you ever rely on me to get you somewhere. I can’t be the one to help you.” 
My heart stung; the residual burning bubbled in my chest. 
She shifted her hand to my arm, squeezing it. “I didn’t have much help either.” 
I met Granny’s eyes, unsure of what she wanted me to say. Her expression transported me back to a humid morning in July, four years earlier, when in a stroke of incredible luck, my house was struck by lightning seven times in one night. The final strike caused an explosion in our attic due to an expertly placed pipe. The shockwave shook the foundations of the house, making me spring awake to a blare of alarms and black smoke and my heart pounding in my ears. I sprinted into the hallway, where Mom grabbed my wrist and led me outside. Dad and my twin sister weren’t too far behind us. While my parents went back for our dogs, they sent my sister and I across the street to my aunt’s. My aunt was a heavy sleeper. The rain poured on us as we stood outside, ringing the doorbell over and over until one of my cousins let us in. She and her sisters helped us wash our muddy, bare, feet and brought us new clothes so we could change out of our cold and smokey ones. 
I spent most of that day in my aunt’s kitchen. Granny arrived at the peak of the fire, when the dark haze of the smoke dampened the sunlight peeking through the curtains. She was wearing a long black raincoat, black shirt and trousers, and black rain boots. Granny stood in the doorway and surveyed my family rushing around the kitchen: Mom was on the phone with her mother and my aunt was trying her best to make scrambled eggs for all my cousins and I without oil; my sister, along with my cousins, were organizing what the firemen were able to pull out of the blaze. My father sat next to the window, watching the fire destroy the home he and Malia built. 
Granny crossed the kitchen to me, and without a word embraced me so tightly it knocked the wind out of me. Her clothes smelled of rose, vanilla, and tobacco. When she pulled away, she gripped me and met my eyes with that expression: Her face was relaxed, static, but her grey eyes were wide and scanning every inch of me. It was something I couldn’t read. 
“Did you get burned?”
I said I was okay. She peered past me. 
“And your sister?”
“Safe too.”
She moved a strand of my hair. “Then, don’t make your father wait on you. He’s a good man, a good father, but he needs your help even if it doesn’t look it.” She paused, measuring her words. “His daughters are his world, you are, keep him grounded.”
The house burned for fourteen more hours after Granny arrived. By the end of it, the house was a dripping charred heap, and what little survived smells like ash to this day. 
When Granny was gazing back at me, as the sunlight weakened and the pings of heavy rain hit the window, I thought of every time she looked down at me: my acceptance into university, my first book, and my first gold medal. I felt the stinging sensation boil over from deep in my bones. The sensation turned into an ice-hot anger, the strongest kind, spite. And the spite traveled to the tip of my tongue. 
I moved my eyes away from Granny. “I wasn’t counting on your help.” 
The loud voices and the rain turned into a discordant choir. My stomach dropped and the visions of my empty grave in the red mud flooded back before Granny said: 
“Have you worked on any writing at all since we last talked?” She asked with a smile. “Or are you considering that law degree now?” She took a sip. 
Her words left the taste of blood in my mouth, the kind of coppery sting that causes a frenzy of jabs. As a child, that taste wasn’t as strong, but in my adulthood, I’ve found myself using spite as my fuel. I will do everything to hit harder, just for the principle, and I’ve learned that its genetic. 
My father told me that even in death Granny’s work would still progress because of us, her legacy. She attempted to perfect her legacy. So, that we could keep up with the pace of her goals when she’s six feet under. Granny wouldn’t allow anything to slow it down. The pandemic, though, was a direct punch to her liver, rendering her unable to stand on her feet. It chained her. It prevented her from patching up the crumbling charities she worked to strengthen, leaving the homeless, children, and sick in the cold. The bodies of her friends were piling at her doorstep, and all she could do was watch. I tried my best to see what was going on behind closed doors, through keyholes, and I watched her scramble to plug every crack in the system from her chains. She was relatively successful, until Grandad shattered his femur. It sent him into a spiral of surgeries and discovering new problems within his over-worked body. Hell would freeze before he retired, though. While trying to take care of him and making sure his role in the business was fulfilled through Zoom calls, she got sick. By the time she recovered, I had returned from my second online semester. 
The day after I arrived, Dad knocked on my bedroom door. 
“Your mom and I are going to see Granny and Grandad. I think they would love to see you,” he said and placed a COVID test on my desk. 
After I tested negative, we drove to my dad’s childhood home. Dad quickly walked up the snowy driveway, up the icy steps, and stood next to a patch of wilting flowers and dead grass as he knocked on the black door. To our surprise, my aunt answered it. While Dad went to go check on Grandad, my aunt explained to Mom and me that Granny decided to do some re-arranging. 
We cut through the kitchen. I noticed a pile of soaking plates and forks in the sink, a collection of coffee mugs, and stained pink wine glasses on the counter. The hallway leading to the living room had dust bunnies scurrying around my feet. The living room walls were bare, we found that every photo had been taken down and re-organized into stacks. My aunt explained that each stack correlated to a wall, and that Granny wanted them hung up in that new order. Granny, though, was nowhere to be found. She had gone to finish up her work for the day. 
Mom, my aunt, and I went to work to hang the photos. Halfway through the second stack, I pulled out a photo of Granny and Dad when he was my age. He was wearing a baggy suit and had no signs of grey hair; Granny had dark hair too and beamed as she posed with him. 
My aunt looked over my shoulder. “Frankie always looked so much like her. The hair, the face, and his smile. He’s the only one of us that really looks like her child.” My aunt laughed a little. “That’s why he’s her favorite.” 
“I never noticed that before,” I said, eying the image of Granny. 
“How could you not? You look just like her too!” 
Mom and my aunt laughed and moved on, but I lingered on the photo. I stared until my eyes unfocused, and my reflection gazed back at me. As we sifted through the stacks, I asked Mom and my aunt about each one Granny was in. The ones in black and white showed her, her mother, and her deceased siblings all wearing matching outfits. Her high school photo had her staring off into the distance, a practiced soft smile the centerpiece. The      grainy, colored photos had a collage of her and Grandad when they were my age – a wedding, the first station, his first car, their first child, their first adoption. The next few were family photos with Granny getting older and her family gradually growing. The photos become saturated once I was born: awards, foundation openings, more stations, graduations, and weddings. 
I held the last photo in the stack. It was Granny and me. She was knelt next to me, her hands squeezing my shoulders with her smiling face squished against mine. I was standing stiffly in my white dobok, barefoot, with my hair braided into pigtails. I held the first-place medal up, proud, with a crooked smile. I brushed my fingertips on the photo, remembering how cold Granny’s hands were in that humid warehouse. 
After we finished, Mom and my aunt asked me to take a glass of wine to Granny’s room. They wanted me to distract her, while they cleaned the house. The walk to her room felt as if I was preparing to climb a cliffside. I took a breath outside her door and knocked. She told me to come in, in a rough voice, and when I opened the door, I found that her bed was filled with piles of papers. The bedsheets were collecting dust. Granny was sitting at her desk by a large window. She was a silhouette to me until my vision adjusted. She turned to me, taking off her glasses, and clasped her hands in her lap, before giving me a smile that created crow’s feet in the corners of her eyes. The chair she sat in had a black frame and green details, the back towered over her, it made her look small. 
“Is that for me, or for you?” 
	I crossed the room, handing it to her. “For you.” 
	“Aren’t you twenty-one now? Well, it doesn’t matter. You’re in college you’re probably drinking plenty of wine.”
	“No not really.” 
	“Not a fan of red?”
	“No ma’am, it’s not my favorite.”  
	“A shame.” She motioned for me to sit in the chair across from her, her gold bracelets jingling. “Red wine warms the heart, keeps it healthy. You’ve been eating healthy, haven’t you?”
	“Yes, I have.”
	“Don’t have too much beer. Or pints as they call it.” She took a sip, before placing the glass on a stack of handwritten notes. “But how was the semester? Did you have to wear masks to class?”
	“It was good as it could be, and yes I we did.”
	“Guessing there were no parties then, right? Right. You must have had plenty of time on your hands to write another book? You’re so pale. You must have been writing so much. It looks like you’re wearing a shade too light!” She smiled. “I’m kidding, dear, you have your mother’s wonderful hair and tan skin … But you do remember what I said before you went off with those socialists?” 
	“That if I wasn’t going to Notre Dame, I should have at least gone to Harvard?” 
	“Yes, and you would have seen the sun a little more in Boston. I’m not one to judge though, I haven’t seen the sun in ages either.” She crossed her leg, leaning back. “Is that why you’re here? Did you write another book for me to read while I’m trapped here?” 
	“I worked on a few things. They aren’t done yet though.” 
	“Oh, is it my biography?”
	I smiled. “That would take me decades to write.”
	“No. No.” Granny waved her hand. “There wouldn’t be much to it, unless you fibbed…” 
	“I think there’s plenty I could write about without lying. Give your work some credit.” 
	Granny paused, before shrugging. “It was easy. It kept me from going crazy.” She trailed off. “I doubt anyone would want to read about a rich old bat complain, not when I’ve been blessed with so much.” 
	“I don’t think it’s complaining.”
	“You must like those sob stores then. I’ve never been a fan.”
	I paused. “Granny, can I ask you something?” 
	“Sure dearie.” 
	“Do you not think you deserve all this?” 
	She frowned, looking away, as she hesitated. “I said the wrong thing, I haven’t been blessed one bit. Blessed means lucky. It means it’s been handed to you. You’ve been blessed. I’ve worked for everything I have. Blessing means it can never go away, but everything I have could slip through my fingers if I didn’t pay attention.” 
	I nodded. “Is that why you keep working? What’s kept you going for this long?”
	Her grey eyes met mine, a calculated smile with dimples formed, as she traced her fingers over her thick brows. Granny rested her angular face in her palm. “It sounds like you are writing my biography. When’s it coming out?” 
	I gave her the same smile, not pressing more. “Whenever you want.” 
	There was a pause. Her full attention remained on me, as she said, “don’t ever do what I would have wanted, Emma. Work hard, but don’t do what I want. That won’t help you.” Her eyes became distant, watery. “Put your heart into it, if you ever write it, and not just your love; put all your anger into it. That’s the only gift I’ve ever given you, rage. It’s the only way you’ll be able to make progress.” 
	The clouds parted, the blizzard let up, and the sunlight came in. I could see the precipice from the bottom. The cold paused, it was my only chance, so I climbed: her past fueling me. She was an aspiring entrepreneur at twenty-one, trying to lift herself from poverty; A younger sister at thirty at her alcoholic brother’s funeral, adopting his child as her own; An unwilling matriarch at thirty-five, learning the news of her mother’s death in a house-fire caused by a cigarette; A mother at forty-two, sitting in the silence of her first office after being diagnosed with breast cancer; A grandmother fueled by anger, spite, and love, whose purpose is to keep climbing no matter the circumstances. There is nothing supernatural about her work-ethic, it was the only thing she could control while everything fell apart. 
	I spent too long confusing her care and attention as coldness. She saw something in my heart nobody else had – her reflection. And, she is mine. I would have extended my hand to every portrait of her. I would have begged her to let me be by her side just in case she slipped. But she beat me to the top, where her hands were frost-bitten, and her eyes were strained from the sun beating down on them. There was no way down for someone who could not see the bottom anymore. She had to press on, there was no waiting for me. Her chest was heaving in the thin air.
